        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Aldous Exequiel S. Damaso. I like to think of myself as the guy who cracks jokes every now
            and then that really make you laugh your heart out. Currently, I am a college student struggling to keep up with my peers.
            I feel lost and unsure of what to do with myself. I no longer have fun, I don't vibe with others,
            and it just doesn't feel like it used to.</p>

        <p>Back when I was in high school and senior high school years, I used to have so much fun with others.
            I would often get called to the guidance office because of it.
            I even accidentally made a girl cry once when I bounced a volleyball and it hit her face.
            I got into fights and made unnecessary choices and decisions, but those choices and decisions made me who I am today.</p>

        <p>Although the current version of myself may not be the best, I acknowledge that I have gained knowledge and
            wisdom throughout the years. I am proud to stand beside others and proud of myself for how far I've come.
            I will look forward to a bright future with a not so bright smile but bright nonetheless.
            Cheers to you all, most excellent, non-dubious, and non-bogus dudes!</p>
